# CLERK: a multicultural LLM for inclusive societies

Building technologies that exhibit groundbreaking language abilities raises crucial questions about whom they should target. Each country is a multilingual setting where different varieties of languages and a number of minority languages are spoken. This is particularly true for Italy, where the role of dialects and relatively recent immigration produced a multi-linguistic society. Large Language Models (LLMs) may be useful in such a multilingual context, since they could foster communication among citizens and between citizens and Public Administration (PA). Unfortunately, these technologies are not designed to be linguistically inclusive: their quality is measured by companies over a standardized language, and little effort is made to account for cultural differences when pre-trained models are created. The aim of our project is to release CLERK, a multilingual and multicultural LLM for the promotion of inclusive societies. 

### Ethical Board
In order to periodically assess the ethical compliance of our project, we will form an ethical board of experts in AI and society. The ethical board will evaluate all milestones related to the LLM development.
